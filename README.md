##  About the project

<table>
<tr>
<td>

A collection of solutions for GFG,Leetcode,InterviewBit data structures and algorithm problems in Python, JAVA, and CPP. This community-owned project aims to bring together the solutions for the DS & Algo problems across various platforms, along with the resources for learning them. Problems from Leetcode will be included soon in the project.
